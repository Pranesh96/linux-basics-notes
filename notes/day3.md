## Day 3 – Pipes and Redirection

Key concepts:
- STDOUT vs STDERR
- Pipes (|)
- Overwrite (>) vs Append (>>)

Important realizations:
- Pipes avoid temporary files
- grep + wc is extremely powerful
- Errors can be redirected separately

Production mindset:
- Always pipe, never manually re-open files
