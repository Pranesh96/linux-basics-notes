## Day 4 – Permissions and Ownership

Key ideas:
- r, w, x mean different things for files vs directories
- Scripts need execute permission
- chmod changes permissions
- chown changes ownership

Common mistakes:
- Using 777 blindly
- Forgetting execute bit
- Wrong shebang

Production mindset:
- Fix permissions, don’t bypass them
